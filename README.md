mobs-plus-areas-modpack-master
==============================

A modpack for Minetest containing modified versions of mobs and areas, 
as well as a special mod containing various foodstuffs used by mobsplus.

This version of mobs, dubbed 'mobsplus', combines elements of PilzAdam's [mobs] mod 
and krupnovpavel's [kpgmobs] mod.  It also depends upon this modified version of areas.

The modified areas code allows the use of a new /area_mobs command that lets area owners 
set the kinds of mobs that can appear in their areas: all, none, hostile, and peaceful.

[mobmeat]'s name is self-explanatory.  Meat for most animals (barring the wolf, who will
drop lamb meat from his last kill) is included, and all can be cooked to become edible.
